  <h1>Amazon Cognito with User Pool and Identity Pool</h1>
  <p><strong>Amazon Cognito</strong> is a service provided by AWS that helps you manage user authentication and access control for your applications.</p>
  <h2>User Pool</h2>
  <p>Think of a <strong>User Pool</strong> as a secure database where you store user accounts for your application. It handles user registration, authentication, and account management. Users can sign up for accounts, sign in securely, and manage their profiles within the User Pool.</p>
  <h2>Identity Pool</h2>
  <p>An <strong>Identity Pool</strong>, on the other hand, is like a bridge between your user authentication system (User Pool) and AWS services. It allows authenticated users to access AWS resources securely without exposing their AWS credentials. Identity Pools provide temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to authenticated users, enabling them to access AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, or API Gateway.</p>
  <p>In simple terms, User Pool manages user accounts and authentication for your application, while Identity Pool provides a secure way for authenticated users to access AWS resources without directly exposing their AWS credentials.</p>
  <p>Together, User Pool and Identity Pool form the backbone of user authentication and access control in AWS, helping you build secure and scalable applications with ease.</p>
